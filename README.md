# Simple TCP Example Programme in Python

This is just a simple client-server application to demonstrate how to write a client-server
application in Python that uses TCP.

To run the sever 
```bash
python server/main.py
```

To run the client (should be done in a separate window)
```bash
python client/main.py
```

Both the client and server use .json files for configuration (both named config.js)
