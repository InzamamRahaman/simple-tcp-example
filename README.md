# Simple TCP Example Programme in Python

## Summary

This is just a simple client-server application to demonstrate how to write a client-server
application in Python that uses TCP.

To run the sever 
```bash
python server/main.py
```

To run the client (should be done in a separate window)
```bash
python client/main.py
```

The client and the server use the .json files client_config.json and server_config.json respectively for configuration.
The accepted properties of the configuration files are detailed in the READMEs of their respecitive folders.
